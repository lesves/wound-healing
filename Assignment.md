# Wound Healing Analyzing Tool
- Create a web-based GUI to analyze the wound healing process automatically.
- The program will act as an interactive player of individual time frames with the detected part of the wound marked.
- This segmented part of the wound can be additionally modified by moving the boundary points.
- The program will also show the counted statistics according to the segmentation (surface, boundary roughness, etc.). 
- Use Python and its libraries as the programming language.
